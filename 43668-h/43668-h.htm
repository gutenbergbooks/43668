[Arber’s Transcript, II. 648.]
</p></div>

<p>No edition, however, is known before 1598, and it would
be natural to suspect that the original impression had perished
were it not for the fact that 1598 is also the date of the
earliest known edition of the <i>Famous Victories</i>. In the
circumstances we may suppose that publication was for some
reason delayed. The impression of 1598 is a quarto printed
by Creede in roman type of a size approximating to
modern pica (20 ll. = 84 mm.). Of this four copies are known
to survive. That in the British Museum wants the leaf A 4,
which has been supplied in very inaccurate modern reprint.
Fortunately the leaf is present in the Dyce copy at South
Kensington, though in this H 1 is defective (a corner being
supplied in not quite accurate facsimile) and sheet K is
wrongly perfected. Another copy, formerly at Bridgewater
House, is now in the possession of Mr. Henry E.
Huntington; while a fourth is in a collected volume once
in the possession of Charles II, which formed lot 8258 in
the Huth Sale (25 June 1920). All four want the first leaf,
which was presumably blank, except perhaps for a signature.
It has not been possible to use more than the first two copies
mentioned in preparing the present reprint.</p>

<p>The title-page bears the name of Robert Greene as author,
together with a motto used by him in other works, which
suggests that the manuscript may have been in some manner
prepared for press before his death in 1592. Three passages
from the play are quoted, rather inaccurately, in <i>England’s
Parnassus</i>, 1600, above Greene’s name. The title-page also
states that the play had been ‘sundrie times publikely plaide’,
without, however, mentioning any company.</p>

<p>The plot is entirely unhistorical, and P. A. Daniel and
W. Creizenach independently traced its source to the first
novel of the third day of the <i>Ecatommiti</i> of Giraldi Cintio,
a story in which, however, the identity of the characters is
quite different. Whether Greene was also acquainted with
Cintio’s play <i>Arrenopia</i>, based on the same story, is not
known.</p>


<h2><span class="smcap"><a id="List_of_Doubtful_and_Irregular_Readings"></a>List of Doubtful and Irregular Readings.</span></h2>


<p>The play, evidently printed from a much altered and probably illegible
manuscript, abounds in errors of every description. The following list is
confined to such readings as are to some extent doubtful in the original
and to a few literal misprints which might otherwise perhaps be thought
due to the reprint. No irregularities recorded by previous editors are included.
No variations of any importance have been found between the
two copies collated.</p>

this may be meant for it is clear that the speeches belong to the Bishop of
St. Andrews. In ll. 2015-6 a complicated error has occurred, the ‘e’ of
‘her’ in the lower line having worked its way up into an accidental space

<p>In V. iii the speeches of the King of England have the prefix ‘Arius’
(ll. 2095, 2105, 2126, 2129), a name which in a stage-direction in II. ii (l. 1050)
is apparently applied to the King of Scots. Ateukin (twice misprinted
‘Auteukin’, ll. 1451, 2562) is repeatedly called Gnato, which would seem
to have been the original name of the character, subsequently altered, for in
I. i ‘Ateukin’ several times scans as a dissyllable (ll. 355, 362, 365). Twice
Ateukin and Gnato are mentioned together in a stage-direction (ll. 1550,
2053), apparently through misunderstanding of an alteration. Sir Eustace,
who is also addressed as Lord Eustace, is several times called Dick (ll. 565,
568, 571, 601, 608, 629). One speech (l. 629) assigned to him, clearly
belongs to a servant, who has therefore been added to the characters. In II.
ii Nano is throughout called ‘Dwarfe’ except in the exit at l. 1049.
Andrew’s surname appears from l. 551. The name of the King of Fairies
is Oberon: ‘Oboram’ on the title and ‘Obiran’ in l. 1934. seem to be
mere misprints, and ‘Obiron’ (ll. 1164, 1923, 1931) a sporadic variant.
In l. 2 his name is given as ‘After Oberõ’, but this is most likely a misprint
for ‘<i>after</i> Oberõ’. Dyce supposed that Oberon entered at l. 2398, and
Grosart assumed that ‘Adam’ was the name of the actor who played the
part, but it is more likely to be a compositor’s misreading of ‘A danc(e)’.
At l. 1953 the direction ‘Ladie Anderson ouerheares’ is due to a misunderstanding;
it should be ‘Sir Cutbert’. Lady Douglas and Sir Egmond
are mentioned in l. 1606 as present, but nothing further is known of them:
Lord Percy and Samles enter in V. iii (l. 2094), and the former again in
V. vi (l. 2407), also the English herald in V. vi (l. 2338), but none of them
speak. Nano does not speak in the Induction.</p>

<p>In l. 656 (cf. 666) the form ‘Staurobates’, in place of Stabrobates, proves
that Greene drew from Poggio’s Latin translation of Diodorus Siculus and
not from the original.</p>

<p>The text of the play contains nothing to identify either the English or
the Scottish king, and the date 1520 given in the Induction is seven years
after the death of James IV at Flodden.</p>
